   // in C and C++, arrays have an intimate relationship with pointers.
   int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   // *the name of an array variable is also a pointer to the first element*
   p1 = numbers; // make p1 point to the first element in numbers

   *p1 = 100; // what changed?


   // *pointers can be indexed like arrays*. what exactly is going on here?
   cout << p1[0] << endl; // index 0 of a pointer???

   cout << p1[2] << endl; // what is the output?


   /* EXERCISE:
   Suppose "numbers" has a memory address of 100. What are the addresses of each
   element in numbers? numbers[0], #100; numbers[1], #104; numbers[2], #108;
		       numbers[3], #112; numbers[4], #116;







   How did you calculate this?

   // more fun with pointers to arrays.
   // if I *add 1 to a pointer, I "advance" the pointer by "1 position"*
   int *p3 = p1 + 1; // p3 points to numbers[1]
   *p3 = 200;

   // this can be combined in one line as such:
   *(p1 + 2) = 0; // sets numbers[2] = 0
   *(p1 + 3) = 0; // sets numbers[3] = 0;
   // seeing a pattern?

   // this gives us a sexy form of for loop:
   for (int *itr = numbers; itr != numbers + 5; itr++) {
      cout << *itr << endl;
   }
   // what is this doing? move pointers down each address after it points


   // another famous loop: *copy 5 elements from numbers to a new array*
   int copyNumbers[5]; // uninitialized
   for (int *i = numbers, *j = copyNumbers; i != numbers + 5; i++, j++) {
      *j = *i;
   }


   // lessons: *arrays are pointers; pointers can be treated as arrays.* 
   // when does this make sense? when does it not?


   return 0;
