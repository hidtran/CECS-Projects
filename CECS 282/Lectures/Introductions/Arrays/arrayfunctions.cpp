   // what does arr look like on the stack? Information does not require from arr, but actually point to the first element in the number of 	  stack, like a forwarding address.
   arr[0] = 100;
}

void ProcessMatrix(int m[3][3]) { // can specify both dimensions too
   m[0][2] = 1000;
   m[0][3] = 5000; // is there a matrix element at 0, 3? No, because only column runs from 0 - 2. Instead, it goes to m[1][0] = m[0][3].
}

// SUMMARY
// arrays of all dimensions are not duplicated when passing to functions, so 
// any change in the function will change the same array as referenced at the
// calling site.
// multidimensional arrays align their contents in a "sequential block".
