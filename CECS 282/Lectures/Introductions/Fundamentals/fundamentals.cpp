   int y;


   // normal math operators are the same as in Java: + - * / %

   // what you expect. Evaluate from left to right with the rules of operator.

   // bools are actually integers and can be assigned integer values. 
   // any non-zero integer is treated as "true"

   // what is the output?



   // if you involve a bool in arithmetic, it is treated as having a value of 1 
   // if true, and 0 if false. x = 16 + 1 = 17 (b is true = 1)
   x = x + b;

   // integer values can be expressed in hex (base 16) or oct (base 8) notation:
   x = 0x2A; // 0x --> start of a hex number (2*16 + 10*1 = 42)
   y = 031;  // 0  --> start of an octal number (3*8 + 1*1 = 25)



   // char types are for characters. character literals are enclosed in ''
   char c = 'A';
   // characters have integer values according to the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code chart. you can
   // assign a char to an int, and the int will have the ASCII code for the char
   x = c;
   
   //  this has interesting consequences
   char d = x + 5;
   cout << "D value: " << d << endl;

   // C++ DOES NOT GUARANTEE the # of bytes for most fundamental types. it only
   // makes the following promise:

   // sizeOfChar = 1
   // sizeOfShort <= sizeOfInt <= sizeOfLong < sizeOfLongLong
   
   // the actual sizes are IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT 
   // (whoever wrote the compiler gets to choose)



   // signed vs unsigned
   signed short ss = 32768; // the "signed" is optional and rarely used
   unsigned short us = 32768; // use the MSB for data, not for a sign. 
   // char, short, int, long can all be unsigned
