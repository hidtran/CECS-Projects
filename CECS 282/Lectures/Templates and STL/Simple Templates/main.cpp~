   // SUPPOSE: we want to use Median with the other fundamental types:
   // char, short, long, long long, float, double, long double.
   // Which of these types will work with our current Median function?




   // But what about the rest? What if we want the median of 3 doubles?





   // C++ uses "templates" to mark functions that are (mostly) type-agnostic.
   // See the file TemplateHeaders.h

   cout << "The median of 8.5, 10.2, and 4.5 is " <<
      MedianTemplate(8.5, 10.2, 4.5) << endl; // what type is T?

   // This works even with non-fundamental types.

   cout << "The median of " << r1 << ", " << r2 << ", and " << r3 << " is " <<
      MedianTemplate(r1, r2, r3) << endl; // what type is T?

   string a = "aaaa", b = "bbbb", c = "bbbc";
   cout << "Medians even work with strings: " << MedianTemplate(a, b, c) << 
      endl;

   // In your own words, describe ALL TYPES THAT WILL WORK with MedianTemplate.
   // Account for user-defined types like Rational.
